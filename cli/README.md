a 3-sigma event is to be expected about every 741 days or about 1 trading day
in every three years;
• a 4-sigma event is to be expected about every 31,560 days or about 1 trading
day in 126 years (!);
• a 5-sigma event is to be expected every 3,483,046 days or about 1 day every
13,932 years(!!)
• a 6-sigma event is to be expected every 1,009,976,678 days or about 1 day
every 4,039,906 years;
• a 7-sigma event is to be expected every 7.76e+11 days – the number of zero
digits is so large that Excel now reports the number of days using scientific
notation, and this number is to be interpreted as 7.76 days with decimal point
pushed back 11 places. This frequency corresponds to 1 day in 3,105,395,365
years.
